\begin_layout Standard
Android is a mobile operating system that is based on a modifi ed version
 of Linux.
 It was originally developed by a startup of the same name, Android, Inc.
 In 2005, as part of its strategy to enter the mobile space, Google purchased
 Android and took over its development work (as well as its development
 team).
 Google wanted Android to be open and free; hence, most of the Android code
 was released under the open source Apache License, which means that anyone
 who wants to use Android can do so by downloading the full Android source
 code.
 Moreover, vendors (typically hardware manufacturers) can add their own
 proprietary extensions to Android and customize Android to differentiate
 their products from others.
 This simple development model makes Android very attractive and has thus
 piqued the interest of many vendors.
 This has been especially true for companies affected by the phenomenon
 of Apple’s iPhone, a hugely successful product that revolutionized the
 smartphone industry.
 Such companies include Motorola and Sony Ericsson, which for many years
 have been developing their own mobile operating systems.
 When the iPhone was launched, many of these manufacturers had to scramble
 to fi nd new ways of revitalizing their products.
 These manufacturers see Android as a solution — they will continue to design
 their own hardware and use Android as the operating system that powers
 it.
 The main advantage of adopting Android is that it offers a unifi ed approach
 to application development.
 Developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should
 be able to run on numerous different devices, as long as the devices are
 powered using Android.
 In the world of smartphones, applications are the most important part of
 the success chain.
 Device manufacturers therefore see Android as their best hope to challenge
 the onslaught of the iPhone, which already commands a large base of application
s.

Omkring Galaxy note 10.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As fully demonstrated at Samsung’s New York event, the new Galaxy 10.1 provides
 for a compelling new twist – a full-sized tablet that features a touchscreen
 but also uses a stylus to fluidly interact with a wide array of productivity
 and creativity tools.
 You can type using a soft keyboard, or use a finger like any other touchscreen
 tablet.
 But the new 10.1 Note provides the versatility of the S Pen Stylus to navigate
 the Android user interface and take screen shots, jot down notes or sketch/draw
 pictures into many of the tablet’s native apps.
 The pressure-sensitive stylus uses an active Wacom digitizer for precision
 digital inking and a button along its side controls multiple functions.
 This button can also activate a “lock” to disallow other means of input,
 so users can rest their palms or hands on the screen while they are drawing
 or jotting down notes.
 The plastic tip at the other end of the stylus serves as a handy digital
 “eraser.”
